# community-time-bank

A **responsive, fully functional single-page HTML web app** that enables community members to exchange time and skills instead of money. Designed to encourage trust, mutual aid, and skill-sharing within local communities.

## How It Works

- Users **register** with their name, contact, skills offered, and skills wanted.
- Users **post offers** to share their time and skills (e.g., 1 hour math tutoring).
- Other users **browse and request** services based on their needs.
- When services are accepted and completed, the app **logs the exchange** and updates each user's time balance (hours earned and spent).
- Users can **track their balance** and view exchange history.
- A community feed shows recent exchanges and highlights active helpers.
- All data is stored locally on the user's browser — no backend or internet required.
